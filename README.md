# Csc133
This semester we will study object-oriented graphics programming and design by
developing a simple video game we’ll call Sili-Challenge (“Sili” is short for “Silicon” and
pronounced as “Silly” ). In this game you will be controlling a cyborg moving on a track
(probably in Silicon Valley!) defined by bases, while trying to avoid collisions with drones and
other cyborgs and keeping your cyborg charged with energy.
